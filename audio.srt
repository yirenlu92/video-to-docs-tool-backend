In this demo, let's show how to add a source in Big Eye.

1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,520
So here from the app.big Eye.com page,

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,280
you first go to catalog and then to add source.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,000
We add a data source.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,680
You choose the type of data warehouse or database

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,060
that you want to connect.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:22,960
So let's

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,380
choose snowflake.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,980
