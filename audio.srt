00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,320
This is the main readme landing page.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,940
I click on the big eye workspace.

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,820
Then you go to guides.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,920
You pick the category that you want

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,140
to create a new page under.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,140
So this could be email.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,140
You write it marked down here.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,140
And make sure to turn off the live link.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,820
Otherwise the page will immediately be live.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,740
Click save.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,740
And then you can delete the page if you want.

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,600
You want.
